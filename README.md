# DVB-CSA algorithm descrambler hardware implementation (IP core)
This repository contains hardware implementation of DVB-CSA algorithm descrambler (used in digital television) written in VHDL.
Source code is synthesizable and divided into three components:
- Block Cipher
- Stream Cipher
- Main Control Unit - which combines the above subcomponents

Each component has its own test bench.
